Welcome to the documentation for the Notary smart contract. This documentation aims to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the contract's functionality, how to interact with it, and potential use cases.

The Notary contract serves as a decentralized solution for timestamping documents on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely record the timestamp of a document, providing an immutable proof of existence and time of creation.


Prerequisites
Before using the Notary contract, ensure you have the following:
Node.js and npm installed
Access to an Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten testnet)
Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts
